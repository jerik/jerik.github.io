# jerik.github.io
snippset and things I want to capture / document

## todos
- Integrate Navigation dropdown with my pages. The page names should be stated in a tag ( meta-tag, own-tag.. ), so that it can be read by js. 
 - For Layout see: https://bootswatch.com/cerulean/
 - For integration see: https://github.com/arturadib/strapdown/blob/gh-pages/src/strapdown.js search for navbar
- perhaps integrate gist, so that I can download the gist and save it in the jerik.github.io? Easy to integrate, but I do not have the gist-code in this git repo...
