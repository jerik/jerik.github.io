snippset and things I want to capture / document

## todos
- Integrate Navigation dropdown with my pages. The page names should be stated in a tag ( meta-tag, own-tag.. ), so that it can be read by js. 
 - For Layout see: https://bootswatch.com/cerulean/
  - Pimp up navbar [strapdown-zeta]( https://github.com/chaitin/strapdown-zeta/blob/master/src/strapdown.js ) see navbar
 - For integration see: https://github.com/arturadib/strapdown/blob/gh-pages/src/strapdown.js search for navbar
- perhaps integrate gist, so that I can download the gist and save it in the jerik.github.io? Easy to integrate, but I do not have the gist-code in this git repo...
- To get the markdown files automated. Try to read the \*.md files and shove them into the textarea field? I have access to files if I know the name e.g. readme.md. The
  textarea field will be replace by the div id="content", I have to inject the markdown syntax there somewhere
- create a [custom domain]( https://help.github.com/articles/using-a-custom-domain-with-github-pages/ )
- optional inform about jekyll: https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-as-a-static-site-generator-with-github-pages/

## todos leanCanvas
- read leanCanvas.md, with # Problem, # Solution etc as headings. # Project, for the projekt title and integrate it in the leanCanvas.html
- make divs flexible, so that it can resize depeding on the content size
- make help-per-topic, which shows some example question with an onmouseover
